## Installation

Install [CRoaring](https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/CRoaring), the C library for Roaring bitmap.

Add the path to this library in your environment:
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/your/CRoaring/build:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
(consider adding this to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` if you do not want to type the command each time you use the library).
